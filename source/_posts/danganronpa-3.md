Welcome to a new world of Danganronpa, and prepare yourself for the biggest, most exhilarating episode yet. Set in a “psycho-cool” environment, a new cast of 16 characters find themselves kidnapped and imprisoned in a school. Inside, some will kill, some will die, and some will be punished. Reimagine what you thought high-stakes, fast-paced investigation was as you investigate twisted murder cases and condemn your new friends to death.


## Key Features
A New Danganronpa Begins: Forget what you thought you knew about Danganronpa and join a completely new cast of Ultimates for a brand-new beginning.

Murder Mysteries: In a world where everyone is trying to survive, nobody’s motivations are quite what they seem. Use your skills to solve each new murder or meet a gruesome end.

Lie, Panic, Debate! The world is shaped by our perception of it. Fast-paced trial scenes will require lies, quick wits, and logic to guide your classmates to the right conclusions.

New Minigames: Between the madness of murdered peers and deadly trials, enjoy an abundance of brand-new minigames!
